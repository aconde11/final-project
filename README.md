This analysis is part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program and aims to explore a data set containing 100k medical appointments. The data set contains unique ID number for each patient. There are also 14 other associated variables that the patient would answer to if if was applicable to them. Those variables are Patient ID, Appointment ID, Gender, the day someone registered the appointment, the day the of the actual appointment, age, Neighborhood, scholarship: if said patient recieved government assistance, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handcap, if patient recieved sms message and the outcome of the appointment. 

In order to clean the data the first thing we did was remove duplicate data. Since each patient had a unique identifier it was easy to remove duplicates as well as the appointment ID. Along with removing duplicate data, we wanted to remove rows that showed up as 'null' and renamed the columns that were important to our analysis.
